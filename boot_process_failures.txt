Boot process failures.

Kernel loads, but fails to mount the root filesystem.
	Main causes here are:
    1. misconfigured GRUB  configuration file
    2. misconfigured /etc/fstab 
    3. no support for the root filesistem type either built into the kernel or as a module in the initramfs  initial ram disk or filesystem.

Failure during the init process.

    • Check the messages that are displayed before things stop. Look out for corrupted filesystems, erros in startup scripts, etc.
    • boot in to a lower boot runlevel such as 3 (no graphics) or 1 (single user  mode)
